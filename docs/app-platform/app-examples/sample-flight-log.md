### Main Body

The **Info** column has changed from a **-** separated list of strings to a JSON Array of values.  Existing events will be JSON Objects of format:

```text
{"message": "existing text"}
```

Newly added events denoting the start of a plan during flight:

```text
{"planId":"5f921be8d09c4ce169e71697","templateId":"5eb9f71600fd224435a9cbe2","projectId":"5e5da0be976932beb266c15f"}
